# AudioListToVideo
Create a (static image) video for each audio file in a list. In other words, the script will iterate through a list of audio files and a list of image files, and create a video using a combination of image and audio. (This can be used to upload sound bits as short videos to Youtube). 
If there are more audio files than images, then the script will loop back and reuse image files.
